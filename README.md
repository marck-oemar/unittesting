# Unit testing 

This repository should actually be called 'Unit testing, the unusual suspects!'

Unit testing might be a familiar concept in the Java, Python and Ruby world, but what about system administrators that maintain and develop BASH and Powershell scripts? 

As it turns out, unit testing is possible for BASH and Powershell, and as a research project I tried to PoC 2 tools, BATS for BASH scripts and Pester for Powershell scripts. 

For more info, see the the README in each directory.
